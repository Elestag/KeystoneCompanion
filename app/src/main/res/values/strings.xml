    <!--Dungeons description -->

    <string name="description_azure_vault">Long ago, Malygos created the Azure Vault as a place for Sindragosa to catalogue and store any curious magical artifacts he found. Locked away and deserted millennia ago, the Vault has since fallen into disrepair, leaving it vulnerable to attacks from without… and within.</string>
    <string name="description_algethar_academy">Long ago, the great Algeth\'ar Academy was a place of higher learning for all dragons. Though it fell dormant with the rest of the Isles, it has reopened and is back under the guidance of Headteacher Doragosa. In a series of exciting, new changes the Academy is currently seeking new students from all walks of life, not just dragons, as well as volunteers to help get it back to the bustling halls of education it once was. Those who walk the Academy grounds are sure to learn something new.</string>
    <string name="description_ruby_life_pools">As the ancestral nesting grounds for the five flights, the Ruby Life Pools is a sacred place. The Red Dragonflight, whose charge it is to nuture all life, protect these pools and the the future of all dragonkind held within them.\r\n\r\nHowever, Raszageth and her Primalists have come to steal that future away and infuse their own powers into the sacred pools. They must be stopped for dragonkind to thrive.</string>
    <string name="description_the_nokhud_offensive">After Clan Nokhud captured the ancient eagle spirit, Ohn\'ahra, civil war spread across the Ohn\'ahran plains like wildfire. To the other clans, Ohn\'ahra is more than a mere spirit: she is their goddess. Primalists summon elemental forces, and necromancers command the spirits of legendary centaur. Beset by enemies, the other Maruuk clans rally. The Nokhud tyrant, Balakar Khan, watches from afar, bellowing commands. Relentless enemy offenses will continue until his forces submit. The battlefield awaits.</string>
    <string name="description_brackenhide_hollow">Brackenhide Hollow is the largest gnoll settlement in the Dragon Isles, and home to unspeakable danger. Decay seeps from the Hollow, spreading among the gnoll tribes of the Azure Span and threatening to rot away all life. In the heart of the Hollow lies the leader of the Brackenhide, and the knowledge she gleefully shares with her withered kin.</string>
    <string name="description_uldaman_legacy_of_tyr">Uldaman is an ancient titan facility where, long ago, allies of the heroic Keeper Tyr hid the Discs of Norgannon.\r\n\r\nAfter returning to the Dragon Isles, Queen Alexstrasza learned of another disc locked away within Uldaman… one that holds the memories of Tyr himself. Believing this knowledge is needed to restore the power of the Aspects, Alexstrasza has asked her mortal allies to brave the perils of Uldaman and recover Tyr\'s memories to secure the future of dragonkind.</string>
    <string name="description_neltharus">Beneath the Obsidian Citadel lies Neltharus, home of the black dragonflight\'s hoard and the secrets behind their legendary forging. When the djaradin woke from their slumber, they chose Neltharus as the point of entry for their attack. Surprised to find it deserted, they quickly laid claim to its secrets for themselves… as well as the rest of the Obsidian Citadel.</string>
    <string name="description_halls_of_infusion">Deep beneath Tyrhold lies the Halls of Infusion. Its structure was built upon an ancient wellspring, the waters of which were channeled by Keeper Tyr to feed the Life Pools of the red flight. Now that the Dragon Isles have reawakened, Primalist forces have invaded these halls. Have they come to destroy the facility… or to reveal secrets that Tyr left behind?</string>

    <string name="description_court_of_stars">Even as Legion troops patrol the streets, casting a pall over the grand city of Suramar, the socialites of the Nightborne nobility continue to cling to custom and routine. On this clear night, the cry of revelers echoes through the chill air, as the largest mansion in the Noble District opens its doors for a grand gala. Rumor has it that Grand Magistrix Elisande herself may be making an appearance, in an effort to reassure several of her closest allies despite recent turmoil.</string>
    <string name="description_halls_of_valor">In the clouds high above Stormheim, the titanic keeper Odyn has called the greatest vrykul warriors of Azeroth to be his Valarjar. Amidst feasting halls and hunting grounds, these ascended vrykul test themselves and prepare for the great war that is to come. Adventurers must pass through these halls and prove their worth if they hope to stand before Odyn and claim the Aegis of Aggramar.</string>
    <string name="description_temple_of_the_jade_serpent">Rising high above the east coast of Pandaria, the Temple of the Jade Serpent stands as a sacred monument to the legendary pandaren emperor Shaohao\'s victory over the Sha of Doubt thousands of years ago. Recently, a disastrous conflict in the Jade Forest unleashed the sha, and several of the entities  have raided the temple\'s most treasured stores of wisdom and knowledge.</string>
    <string name="description_shadowmoon_burial_grounds">The traditional burial grounds of the Shadowmoon clan are the final resting place for countless generations of ancestors. The fallen chieftain Ner\'zhul, in the depths of his depravity, has sacrificed the very soul of his clan in a desperate quest for power. Now the ancestral spirits are restless, tormented and used to fuel dark rituals that will pull all of Draenor into the void if allowed to run their course.</string>

    <string name="description_neltharions_lair">The Earth Warder Neltharion, later known as Deathwing, once called this cavern home. Since his fall, the drogbar that once worshipped the great dragon built their capital within this ancient lair. Now, Dargrul, chieftain of the drogbar, rallies a massive army within these depths. Bolstered by the Hammer of Khaz\'goroth, this army will surge from the mountainside if left unchecked, devastating Highmountain and threatening the security of all Azeroth.</string>
    <string name="description_the_underrot">Deep within the swamps of Nazmir, a blight grows beneath the surface. Unless this corruption is purged immediately, its influence will spread across the land like a ravenous plague, leaving behind nothing but a festering world.</string>
    <string name="description_freehold">Freehold has traditionally served as a haven for pirates, scoundrels, and those who wish to live free of Kul Tiran control. Now, the Irontide Raiders have brought the city under their harsh rule and are coercing the various pirate crews under their banner. While the pirates gather, a small group of heroes must infiltrate the town and eliminate their leadership to dissolve this growing alliance of cutthroats.</string>
    <string name="description_the_vortex_pinnacle">The Vortex Pinnacle exists within the elemental plane of Skywall. Its elegant structures, crowned with bronze and gold, sit atop platforms bridged by pure air. Yet behind its exterior beauty, the pinnacle harbors Neferset tol\'vir, as well as Al\'Akir the Windlord\'s merciless elemental legions. As long as the barrier between Skywall and Azeroth remains open, terror will rain down on Uldum from the skies.</string>

    <string name="description_leymor">Leymor was born of a humble seedling that Malygos found in a pool of ley energy. Once but a small sprout in Sindragosa\'s garden, over millennia Leymor has shot up like a weed. Left to its own devices, the looming giant would surely overrun the entirety of the Azure Vault.</string>
    <string name="description_azureblade">As security for the Vault, Azureblade refused to leave when it was sealed, choosing duty over safety. When the blue dragons failed to return, her bitter resignation drove her to eventual madness. Extending her own life with the magics she was sworn to protect, Azureblade now claims ownership over all the blue dragonflight left behind.</string>
    <string name="description_telash_greywing">Furious at the blue dragonflight, Telash Greywing is determined to find the secrets that Sindragosa has been hiding in the Arcane Vault. Together with the Sundered Flame, he is certain he will discover more about the origins of the dracthyr… and incriminating evidence against the blue dragonflight.</string>
    <string name="description_umbrelskul">Millennia ago, Umbreskul unwittingly meddled with raw arcane power. Riddled with crystalline growths, he was taken to the Azure Vault until a cure could be found. Sadly, the Vault was sealed away before the research was completed, leaving Umbrelskul sleeping in stasis… until now.</string>
    <!--AA -->
    <string name="description_vexamus">As one of the most tenured professors in the academy, Maxdormu uses his powers as a bronze dragon to help bring his history lessons to life. While this proves to be quite an educational and fun experience, it can occasionally go awry. Vexamus is one of Professor Maxdormu\'s favorite lessons, but if any historical detail is inaccurate he will be quick to scold any rowdy students.</string>
    <string name="description_overgrown_ancient">Professors Mystakria and Ichistrasz have used just a touch too much magic in an effort to clear the botany labs. Now they have a big, leafy problem on their hands in the form of an Overgrown Ancient that threatens to undo all their hard work.</string>
    <string name="description_crawth">The Lish Llrath, or Talon Toss, arena is quite literally for the birds these days. Crawth has taken up residence in the center of the arena and has no immediate plans to move out soon. Let\'s see if we can get her to play ball… and leave.</string>
    <string name="description_echo_of_doragosa">Headteacher Doragosa thought of everything when it came to Algeth\'ar Academy. Including a complex simulacrum of herself to take care of any day to day tasks and upkeep while the Isles lay dormant. Now that the Academy is open once again, perhaps she can use it to help keep track of all the new students. It\'s done a fine job in the interim, and is absolutely the one spell that did not degrade after all these years. Perfectly stable and helpful. Right?</string>

    <string name="description_melidrussa_chillworn">Melidrussa Chillworn leads the Primalist infusion efforts in the Ruby Life Pools. Her fervent belief is that she is protecting young dragon eggs from the influence of the titans and cleansing them from the stain of Order magic.

    <string name="description_kokia_blazehoof">As Primalist forces assault the Ruby Life Pools from all sides, it falls to Kokia and her Blazebound lieutenants to capture precious eggs from overwhelmed defenders, all while spreading flame and havoc as they go.</string>
    <string name="description_kyrakka_and_erkhart_stormvein">Kyrakka and Erkhart roam the skies above the Ruby Life Pools coordinating attacks on the shrine below, while also taking out any interfering dragons.

    <string name="description_hackclaws_war_band">Rira Hackclaw and her compatriots, Gashtooth and Tricktotem, have risen up as a deadly war-band among the Brackenhide. Their tactics are the reason tuskarr never travel alone, and their strength is the reason Wratheye has them guarding the gate to the Hollow.</string>
    <string name="description_treemouth">Withered by decay, this once proud ancient has been dubbed Treemouth by the gnolls. As the rot settled into its branches, so too did it settle in the poor creature\'s mind, leaving a creature bent on nothing more than the need to feed and spread decay.</string>
    <string name="description_gutshot">This sharpshooting gnoll has mastered the art of hunting, trapping, and killing her prey. Impressed by her abilities and cunning, the Decatriarch has assigned Gutshot to oversee and train the other hunters… and take out any interlopers that might venture too far into Brackenhide.</string>
    <string name="description_decatriarch_wratheye">Wratheye discovered decay magic in her thirst for power, and declared herself the Decatriarch after mastering it. She now builds the strength of the Brackenhide by spreading her dark magic among her tribe so the tuskarr, and all of the Azure Span, will rot in its wake.</string>

    <string name="description_the_lost_dwarves">The quest for ancient knowledge, untold riches, and worldwide fame has lured brothers Eric, Olaf, and Baelog into the depths of Uldaman once again.

    <string name="description_bromach">The burly Bromach is chieftain of the Stonevault troggs, a brutal bunch who believe that Uldaman\'s treasures belong to them. While Bromach has a particular distaste for meddling dwarves, he\'s determined that no outsiders will get past him.</string>

Sentinel Talondras was charged with defending the route to the disc holding Tyr\'s memories, and is determined to keep the unworthy from laying claim to her maker\'s legacy.</string>
    <string name="description_emberon">Titan vaults are infamous for their intricate defenses, and the halls of Uldaman are no exception. Forged by the skilled hands of Keeper Archaedas long ago, Emberon was imbued with the ability to unleash searing flames upon any who seek to plunder the titans\' secrets.</string>
    <string name="description_chrono_lord_deios">While the Dragon Queen seeks to restore the Aspects\' powers, there are others among dragonkind who do not want to see Alexstrasza\'s plan succeed.
